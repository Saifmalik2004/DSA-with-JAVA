# 🧙‍♂️ Binary Search: A Simple Guide to Fast Searching

Welcome, fellow coder! Are you ready to learn about **Binary Search**? This is a smart way to find something in a sorted list quickly. We will look at two ways to do this: **Iterative Binary Search** and **Recursive Binary Search**. Let’s get started! 


## 📚 What is Binary Search?

Binary search is like having a smart tool that helps you find a specific item in a **sorted** list (like words in a dictionary). Instead of checking each item one by one, binary search cuts the search area in half each time.

### 🔍 How Does Binary Search Work?

Imagine you want to find the word **“fight”** in a dictionary. Instead of starting from the first page and flipping through each word, you:

1. **Open the dictionary to the middle.**
2. You see **“giraffe.”** Since **“giraffe”** comes **after** **“fight,”** you know to look in the **left half**.
3. In the left half, you open it to the middle again. You might see **“cat.”** Since **“cat”** comes **before** **“fight,”** you move to the **right half** of that section.
4. You keep doing this until you find **“fight.”**

This is the magic of binary search!

### 📖 Example with a Phone Book

Let’s say you want to find a friend’s number in a phone book with last names in alphabetical order.

1. You open the book to the middle and see a name starting with **“M.”** Since **“Smith”** comes **after** **“M,”** you look in the **right half**.
2. In the right half, you open it to the middle again and see **“R.”** Since **“Smith”** comes **after** **“R,”** you go to the right half again.
3. You open it again and see a name starting with **“T.”** Since **“Smith”** comes **before** **“T,”** you now check the left half.
4. You keep narrowing it down until you find **“Smith”** quickly!

## 🔄 Recursion: Calling Itself

### ✨ What is Recursion?

Recursion is a way where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of the same problem. Think of it like nesting dolls: each time you open one, you find a smaller doll inside.

### 🎩 Advantages of Recursion

- **Simplicity**: It makes complex problems easier to solve.
- **Fits Naturally**: Some problems, like trees, are better solved this way.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages of Recursion

- **Memory Use**: Each call takes up space, which can cause problems if it goes too deep.
- **Speed**: It can be slower because of the extra steps involved.

## 🛠️ Iterative Binary Search

### 🧩 What is it?

**Iterative Binary Search** uses loops to keep searching until we find our `key` or run out of options. It’s like following a clear path to your goal!

### 📊 Dry Run Example

Let’s use a sorted list of words to find **“fight.”**

```java
String[] words = {"ant", "bear", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "giraffe", "fight", "zebra"};
String key = "fight"; 
```

**Steps to Follow**:

1. **Start**: 
   - `start = 0` (pointing to `"ant"`)
   - `end = 8` (pointing to `"zebra"`)

2. **First Check**:
   - `mid = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4` (pointing to `"elephant"`)
   - Since **“fight” > “elephant,”** move `start` to `mid + 1` (now `start = 5`).

3. **Second Check**:
   - `mid = (5 + 8) / 2 = 6` (pointing to `"giraffe"`)
   - Since **“fight” > “giraffe,”** move `start` to `mid + 1` (now `start = 7`).

4. **Third Check**:
   - `mid = (7 + 8) / 2 = 7` (pointing to `"fight"`)
   - Since **“fight” == “fight,”** we found it at index **7** (starting from 0).

### 💡 Advantages of Iterative Approach

- **Easy to Understand**: Simple to follow and write.
- **Memory Friendly**: Uses less memory since there are no extra function calls.

### 📝 Example Code

```java
public class IterativeBinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(String[] words, String key) {
        int start = 0; 
        int end = words.length - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2; 
            if (key.compareTo(words[mid]) > 0) {
                start = mid + 1; 
            } else if (key.compareTo(words[mid]) < 0) {
                end = mid - 1; 
            } else {
                return mid; 
            }
        }
        return -1; 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] words = {"ant", "bear", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "giraffe", "fight", "zebra"}; 
        String key = "fight"; 
        int result = binarySearch(words, key);
        if (result < 0) {
            System.out.println("Not found"); 
        } else {
            System.out.println("Word found at index: " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🌌 Recursive Binary Search

### 🔍 What is it?

**Recursive Binary Search** breaks the problem into smaller parts by calling itself. This way, you keep searching without using loops.

### 📊 Dry Run Example

Let’s use the same list of words and find **“fight.”**

```java
String[] words = {"ant", "bear", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "giraffe", "fight", "zebra"}; 
String key = "fight"; 
```

**Steps to Follow**:

1. **Start Call**:
   - `binarySearchRecur(words, key, 0, 8)`

2. **First Call**:
   - `mid = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4` (pointing to `"elephant"`)
   - Since **“fight” > “elephant,”** call `binarySearchRecur(words, key, 5, 8)`.

3. **Second Call**:
   - `mid = (5 + 8) / 2 = 6` (pointing to `"giraffe"`)
   - Since **“fight” > “giraffe,”** call `binarySearchRecur(words, key, 7, 8)`.

4. **Third Call**:
   - `mid = (7 + 8) / 2 = 7` (pointing to `"fight"`)
   - Since **“fight” == “fight,”** we found it at index **7** (starting from 0).

### 💡 Advantages of Recursive Approach

- **Clean and Simple**: It can be easier to read and understand.
- **Natural Fit**: Works well for problems that fit naturally into smaller parts.

### 📝 Example Code

```java
public class RecursiveBinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearchRecur(String[] words, String key, int start, int end) {
        if (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; 
            if (key.compareTo(words[mid]) > 0) {
                return binarySearchRecur(words, key, mid + 1, end); 
            } else if (key.compareTo(words[mid]) < 0) {
                return binarySearchRecur(words, key, start, mid - 1); 
            } else {
                return mid; 
            }
        }
        return -1; 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] words = {"ant", "bear", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "giraffe", "fight", "zebra"}; 
        String key = "fight"; 
        int result = binarySearchRecur(words, key, 0, words.length - 1); 
        if (result < 0) {
            System.out.println("Not found"); 
        } else {
            System.out.println("Word found at index: " + result); 
        }
    }
}
```
