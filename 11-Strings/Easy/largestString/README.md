This simple Java program demonstrates how to find the "largest" string in an array of strings based on lexicographical (dictionary) order. In Java, strings are compared lexicographically, meaning `"mango"` is considered larger than `"banana"`, and `"banana"` is larger than `"apple"`.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Initialize the Largest String**:
   - We start by assuming the first element in the array (`arr[0]`) is the largest string. This value will be compared with the other elements as we iterate through the array.

2. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - We use a `for` loop, starting from the second element, and compare each element to the current largest string.
   - If an element is lexicographically larger than the current largest string, we update `largest` to this new string.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After looping through all elements, `largest` will hold the lexicographically largest string in the array.

4. **Test the Method**:
   - In the `main` method, we create a sample array `{"apple", "banana", "mango"}`.
   - We then call the `largestString` method and print the result.

## üîç Code Explanation

### Class Definition

- **`public class LargestString`**: This defines the class `LargestString`, which contains the logic for finding the largest string in a given array.

### Method Definition

- **`public static String largestString(String[] arr)`**: This method, `largestString`, takes an array of strings as input and returns the largest string found.

### Variable Initialization

- **`String largest = arr[0];`**: We initialize `largest` to the first element of the array, assuming it is the largest to start.

### Loop and Comparison

- **`for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++)`**: This loop iterates through the array from the second element.
  
- **`if (largest.compareTo(arr[i]) < 0)`**: The `compareTo` method checks if `largest` is lexicographically smaller than `arr[i]`. If `largest.compareTo(arr[i])` returns a negative value, it means `arr[i]` is "larger."
  
- **`largest = arr[i];`**: We update `largest` to `arr[i]` if it is larger.

### Return and Main Method

- **`return largest;`**: After the loop, the method returns the largest string found.
  
- **`public static void main(String[] args)`**: The main method, which serves as the entry point of the program.
  
- **`String arr[] = {"apple", "banana", "mango"};`**: We define an array of strings to test our method.

- **`System.out.println(largestString(arr));`**: We print the result of `largestString(arr)`, which should be the largest string.

## üíª Example Output

When you run this program, the output will be:

```plaintext
mango
```

## üìå Key Points

- **Lexicographical Order**: Java compares strings based on lexicographical order.
- **Immutability**: Strings in Java are immutable, so each comparison does not alter the original array.
- **Efficiency**: By iterating through the array once, this method efficiently finds the largest string without needing additional memory.
