# Doubly Linked List - `search` Method

## Overview

The `search` method in this implementation is used to search for a specific element in a doubly linked list. The method utilizes a **bidirectional search** technique by using two pointers, one starting from the `head` and the other from the `tail`, and traverses the list towards the middle. This approach is more efficient than searching from one end only, especially when the list is large.

## Approach

1. **Check if the list is empty**:
   - If the list is empty (i.e., `head == null`), the method prints a message and returns `-1` to indicate that the element is not found.

2. **Set up two pointers**:
   - **`start`**: A pointer that starts from the `head` of the list.
   - **`end`**: A pointer that starts from the `tail` of the list.
   - **`startPos`**: Position tracker for the `start` pointer, initialized to 0.
   - **`endPos`**: Position tracker for the `end` pointer, initialized to the last index (size - 1).

3. **Bidirectional search**:
   - The method checks the data at both `start` and `end` pointers.
   - If either pointer's data matches the target, it returns the position of the pointer.
   - Both pointers move towards the middle:
     - `start` moves to the next node.
     - `end` moves to the previous node.
     - The `startPos` and `endPos` are updated accordingly.

4. **Terminate search**:
   - If the target is not found, the method prints a message and returns `-1`.

## Code

```java
public int search(int target) {
    if (head == null) {
        System.out.println("List is empty.");
        return -1; // Return -1 to indicate that the element is not found
    }

    Node start = head; // Pointer starting from the head
    Node end = tail;   // Pointer starting from the tail
    int startPos = 0;  // Position tracker for the start pointer
    int endPos = size - 1; // Position tracker for the end pointer

    // Traverse from both ends towards the middle
    while (startPos <= endPos) {
        if (start.data == target) {
            return startPos; // Target found at start pointer
        }
        if (end.data == target) {
            return endPos; // Target found at end pointer
        }

        start = start.next; // Move start pointer forward
        end = end.prev;     // Move end pointer backward
        startPos++;         // Increment start position
        endPos--;           // Decrement end position
    }

    // If we exit the loop, the element is not in the list
    System.out.println("Element not found in the list.");
    return -1; // Return -1 to indicate that the element is not found
}
```

## Dry Run Example

Consider the list `[10] <-> [20] <-> [30] <-> [40] <-> [50]` and the target value `30`.

### Initial Setup:

- **List**: `head -> [10] <-> [20] <-> [30] <-> [40] <-> [50] <- tail`
- **`start` pointer**: Points to `10` (head).
- **`end` pointer**: Points to `50` (tail).
- **`startPos = 0`** and **`endPos = 4`** (size of list is 5).

### Iteration 1:
- **start data = 10**, **end data = 50**: Neither matches `30`.
  - Move `start` to `20`, move `end` to `40`.
  - Increment `startPos` to `1`, decrement `endPos` to `3`.

### Iteration 2:
- **start data = 20**, **end data = 40**: Neither matches `30`.
  - Move `start` to `30`, move `end` to `30`.
  - Increment `startPos` to `2`, decrement `endPos` to `2`.

### Iteration 3:
- **start data = 30**, **end data = 30**: Found `30` at both pointers.
  - Return `2` as the position of the target element.

### Final Output:
- The target `30` is found at position `2`.

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case (O(1))**: If the target is at the `head` or `tail`, the search will return in the first iteration.
- **Worst Case (O(n))**: If the target is not found or is in the middle, the search will take `n/2` steps. Hence, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

---

## Key Points

- **Bidirectional Search**: This method uses two pointers, one from the `head` and one from the `tail`, making it more efficient than a single pointer approach.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The method handles the case where the list is empty or the element is not found.
- **Efficient Search**: This method reduces the number of iterations by searching from both ends simultaneously.

## Conclusion

This `search` method is an efficient way to find an element in a doubly linked list, leveraging a bidirectional search approach. It offers better performance compared to traditional methods that only search from one end of the list. By moving pointers from both ends toward the middle, it minimizes the total number of steps required to find an element or determine that it's not in the list.
