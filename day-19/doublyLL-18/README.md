## Introduction

A **doubly linked list** is a data structure where each node consists of three components:  
1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.  
2. **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.  
3. **Previous Pointer**: A reference to the previous node in the sequence.  

This structure allows for efficient traversal and modification in both forward and backward directions, making it versatile and powerful in certain scenarios.

## Real-World Applications

Doubly linked lists are commonly used in:  
- **Web Browsers**: Managing history for forward and backward navigation.  
- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo and redo functionality.  
- **Operating Systems**: Handling processes and threads efficiently.  
- **Music Playlists**: Navigating tracks in forward and backward directions.

## What We Will Learn

In this section, we will cover some basic operations of doubly linked lists:

1. **Add First**: Insert a node at the beginning of the list.  
2. **Add Last**: Append a node at the end of the list.  
3. **Remove First**: Remove the node at the beginning of the list.  
4. **Remove Last**: Remove the node at the end of the list.  
5. **Search**: Locate a node with a specific value.  

Each method will have its explanation and implementation in individual files.
