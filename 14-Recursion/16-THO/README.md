# README: Solving the Tower of Hanoi Mystery üèóÔ∏èüß†

Welcome to the fascinating world of **Tower of Hanoi**, where logic, recursion, and strategy join forces! This program demonstrates how to solve the **Tower of Hanoi puzzle** while keeping track of the total moves made.

---

## **What is the Tower of Hanoi?**

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that involves moving **disks** from one rod (source) to another (destination), following these rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time.**
2. **A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.**
3. **There is an auxiliary rod that can be used for temporary storage.**

The goal is to move all disks from the **source rod** to the **destination rod** while adhering to these rules.

## **The Program's Logic**

The solution is implemented using recursion, where the problem is divided into smaller subproblems. Here's the breakdown of the steps:

### **How It Works**:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If there are no disks (`disk == 0`), no moves are required, and the function simply returns.

2. **Recursive Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Move all disks except the largest from the source rod to the auxiliary rod.
   - **Step 2**: Move the largest disk directly to the destination rod.
   - **Step 3**: Move the disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod.

3. **Move Counter**:
   - The program keeps track of every move made during the process by incrementing a `moveCount` variable.

---

### **Key Highlights**

- **Recursive Function**: The `Honoi` function takes the number of disks and rod identifiers (`src`, `using`, `dest`) along with a `moveCount` to track the number of moves.
- **Dynamic Execution**: The function adjusts the moves and rods dynamically for each recursive call.

### Dry Run for Tower of Hanoi with 4 Disks üèóÔ∏è

#### **Initial Setup**:
- **Source rod (src)**: 1  
- **Auxiliary rod (using)**: 2  
- **Destination rod (dest)**: 3  
- **Number of disks (disk)**: 4  
- **Move count starts at**: 0  

We will recursively break the problem into smaller subproblems and solve it step-by-step. Let's trace the execution!

Move 1 disc from 2 to 3
Move 3 disc from 1 to 2
Move 1 disc from 3 to 1
Move 2 disc from 3 to 2
Move 1 disc from 1 to 2
Move 4 disc from 1 to 3
Move 1 disc from 2 to 3
Move 2 disc from 2 to 1
Move 1 disc from 3 to 1

```

### **How Many Moves Does It Take?**
For `n` disks, the minimum number of moves required is:
\[
2^n - 1
\]

For 5 disks:
\[
2^5 - 1 = 31 \, \text{moves}
\]
