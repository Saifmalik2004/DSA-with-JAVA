# Greedy Approach: Minimize the Difference Between Two Arrays

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Problem Description**
Imagine you have two groups of friends: one group loves donuts üç©, and the other loves coffee ‚òï. Each person in the donut group has a certain donut-eating speed, and each person in the coffee group has a coffee-drinking speed. The problem is to match each donut lover to a coffee drinker so that the absolute difference between their speeds is minimized overall.

In technical terms, you‚Äôre given two arrays `a` and `b`. Your goal is to pair the elements of the two arrays in such a way that the sum of the absolute differences between the pairs is as small as possible. Let‚Äôs solve this together! ‚ú®

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**
Let‚Äôs break down the solution:

### Code Snippet
```java
int a[]={4,1,8,7};
int b[]={2,3,6,5};

Arrays.sort(a);
Arrays.sort(b);

int minDiff=0;

for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    minDiff += Math.abs(a[i]-b[i]);
}
System.out.println(minDiff+" ");
```

### Explanation
1. **Input the Arrays**:
   ```java
   int a[]={4,1,8,7};
   int b[]={2,3,6,5};
   ```
   We start with two arrays representing speeds of donut eaters and coffee drinkers.

2. **Sort the Arrays**:
   ```java
   Arrays.sort(a);
   Arrays.sort(b);
   ```
   Sorting helps us pair the smallest elements together, which minimizes the difference. Sorting ensures the greedy approach works!

3. **Initialize the Difference**:
   ```java
   int minDiff=0;
   ```
   This variable will store the total minimum difference.

4. **Calculate Pairwise Differences**:
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
       minDiff += Math.abs(a[i]-b[i]);
   }
   ```
   For each pair of elements (from sorted arrays), compute the absolute difference and add it to `minDiff`.

5. **Output the Result**:
   ```java
   System.out.println(minDiff+" ");
   ```
   Finally, print the total minimum difference.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Example Walkthrough**
Let‚Äôs take the given input:

- `a = {4, 1, 8, 7}`
- `b = {2, 3, 6, 5}`

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Sort the Arrays**:
   - `a` becomes `{1, 4, 7, 8}`
   - `b` becomes `{2, 3, 5, 6}`

2. **Pair the Elements**:
   - Pair 1: `|1 - 2| = 1`
   - Pair 2: `|4 - 3| = 1`
   - Pair 3: `|7 - 5| = 2`
   - Pair 4: `|8 - 6| = 2`

3. **Calculate the Total Difference**:
   - `1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6`

4. **Output**: The result is `6`.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Approach**
This solution uses a **greedy algorithm**:
- Sort the arrays.
- Pair the smallest element in one array with the smallest in the other, the second smallest with the second smallest, and so on. This ensures the minimal difference at every step.

Why is this efficient? Sorting the arrays ensures we‚Äôre always making the best local decision, which leads to the globally optimal solution. üí°

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Pseudo Code**
Here‚Äôs a simplified version of the solution:

```
Input arrays a and b
Sort array a
Sort array b
minDiff = 0
For each index i in arrays:
    minDiff += absolute difference between a[i] and b[i]
Print minDiff
```

Here‚Äôs the complete code with beginner-friendly comments:

```java
import java.util.Arrays; // Import Arrays class for sorting

public class Greedy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input arrays
        int a[]={4,1,8,7};
        int b[]={2,3,6,5};

        // Sort both arrays
        Arrays.sort(a);
        Arrays.sort(b);

        int minDiff=0; // Variable to store total minimum difference

        // Calculate the absolute differences between pairs
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            minDiff += Math.abs(a[i]-b[i]); // Add the absolute difference to minDiff
        }

        // Output the result
        System.out.println(minDiff+" "); // Print the total minimum difference
    }
}
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Complexity Analysis**

### Time Complexity
1. Sorting the arrays: `O(n log n)`
2. Iterating through the arrays: `O(n)`

Overall time complexity: **`O(n log n)`**

### Space Complexity
- Sorting is done in place, so the space complexity is **`O(1)`**.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Takeaways**
- Sorting is a powerful tool that simplifies many greedy problems. ‚åö
- The greedy approach works here because pairing the smallest with the smallest minimizes the overall difference.
- You‚Äôre one step closer to mastering problem-solving with greedy algorithms! Keep going, and don‚Äôt forget to celebrate your progress! üéâ
