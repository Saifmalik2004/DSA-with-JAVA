## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Problem Description**  
Imagine you're running a freelance platform where clients post jobs with deadlines and rewards (profits). You, as the owner, need to assign the jobs to workers. But there‚Äôs a catch!  

- Each job can only be done **within its deadline**.  
- A worker can only do **one job at a time**.  

Your goal? Maximize the **profit** by selecting jobs wisely. üí∏  

For example:  
- Job A: Deadline = 1 day, Profit = $40  
- Job B: Deadline = 4 days, Profit = $20  
Which jobs should you assign to maximize profit? Let‚Äôs find out! üöÄ

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**  

1. **Define the Job Class**  
   - A `Job` has three properties:  
     - `idx`: The job's unique ID.  
     - `deadline`: The day by which the job must be completed.  
     - `profit`: The money you earn if this job is completed.  
     
2. **Initialize Job Information**  
   - Input is a 2D array where each row contains the job's `deadline` and `profit`.  
   - Example: `{{4,20},{1,10},{1,40},{1,30}}` represents four jobs.  

3. **Store Jobs in a List**  
   - Convert the raw job data into `Job` objects and store them in an `ArrayList`.  

4. **Sort Jobs by Profit**  
   - Use `Collections.sort` to sort jobs in descending order of profit. This ensures we prioritize the most lucrative jobs first.  

5. **Assign Jobs Greedily**  
   - Start from the most profitable job and check if it can fit within the deadline. If yes, schedule it! üéØ  

6. **Output the Results**  
   - Print the maximum number of jobs and their indices (IDs) in the optimal order.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Example Walkthrough** üåü  

### Input  
```  
jobsInfo = {{4,20},{1,10},{1,40},{1,30}}  
```  

### Steps  
1. **Convert to Job Objects**  
   ```
   Job 0: Deadline = 4, Profit = 20  
   Job 1: Deadline = 1, Profit = 10  
   Job 2: Deadline = 1, Profit = 40  
   Job 3: Deadline = 1, Profit = 30  
   ```  

2. **Sort by Profit (Descending)**  
   ```
   Sorted Jobs:  
   Job 2 (Profit $40), Job 3 (Profit $30), Job 0 (Profit $20), Job 1 (Profit $10)  
   ```  

3. **Assign Jobs Greedily**  
   - Job 2 ‚úÖ (Deadline = 1)  
   - Job 3 ‚ùå (Deadline = 1, already taken)  
   - Job 0 ‚úÖ (Deadline = 4)  
   - Job 1 ‚ùå (Deadline = 1, already taken)  

4. **Result**  
   - Maximum Jobs: 2  
   - Job Indices: [2, 0]

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Approach**  
The strategy is simple but effective:  
1. Prioritize high-profit jobs (hence, sort by profit).  
2. Assign jobs if their deadline fits within the available time slots.  

Why is this method efficient?  
- By focusing on profit first, we maximize the reward early on.  
- Checking deadlines ensures we don‚Äôt overcommit and leave enough time for other jobs. üí°

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Pseudo Code** üìù  

```
Input: jobsInfo (array of [deadline, profit])  

Step 1: Create Job objects with idx, deadline, and profit.  
Step 2: Sort the jobs in descending order of profit.  
Step 3: Initialize a variable `time = 0` and an empty list `ans`.  

For each job in the sorted list:  
   If the job's deadline > time:  
      Add the job's index to `ans`.  
      Increment `time` by 1.  

Output the size of `ans` and the indices of selected jobs.  
```
