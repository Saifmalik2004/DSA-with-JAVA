# **📚 Day 20: Mastering Stack Data Structure**

## **What is a Stack?**

A **stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.  
This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add plates to the top and remove them from the top.

### **Key Operations of a Stack:**
- **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Remove the top element of the stack.
- **Peek/Top:** View the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.

## **📌 Topics Covered in This Directory**

In this directory, we will dive deep into stacks by implementing them and solving important stack-related problems.  

### **🚀 Stack Implementations**
1. **[Stack-1: Using ArrayList](stack-1/)**  
   Learn to implement a stack from scratch using Java's `ArrayList`.  

2. **[Stack-2: Using LinkedList](stack-2/)**  
   Build a stack using Java's `LinkedList`.  

3. **[Stack-3: Using JCF (Java Collection Framework)](stack-3/)**  
   Implement and utilize stacks with Java's built-in `Stack` class.

### **💡 Questions Solved**
This directory contains **8 important stack-related problems** with step-by-step solutions:

1. **[Push to Bottom](stack-ques-1)**  
   Insert an element at the bottom of the stack without disturbing the existing order.

2. **[Reverse a String Using Stack](stack-ques-2/)**  
   Reverse a string by leveraging the stack data structure.

3. **[Reverse a Stack Using Recursion](stack-ques-3/)**  
   Reverse the elements of a stack recursively without using any auxiliary data structure.

4. **[Stock Span Problem](stack-ques-4/)**  
   Solve the stock span problem to find the number of consecutive days a stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

5. **[Next Greater Element](stack-ques-5/)**  
   Find the next greater element for every element in an array.

6. **[Valid Parenthesis](stack-ques-6/)**  
   Check if the given string of parentheses is valid or not.

7. **[Duplicate Parenthesis](stack-ques-7/)**  
   Detect whether the given string contains any duplicate parentheses.

8. **[Max Rectangle Area in a Histogram](stack-ques-8/)**
