Today, weâ€™re diving into **bit manipulation** once again, but with a twist! Weâ€™re not checking if a number is odd or even â€” weâ€™re looking at specific bits within the number. This lesson covers **how to retrieve the ith bit of a number** using bitwise operations.

### 1. Introduction to Bit Extraction

In many applications, you might need to check if a specific bit within a number is `0` or `1`. Instead of converting the number to binary and manually finding the bit, we can use **bitwise operations** to directly retrieve any bit we want! The technique is efficient and widely used in low-level programming, graphics, and more.

### 2. How Bit Manipulation Works for Extracting Bits

To get the value of a specific bit in a number, we can:
1. **Create a bitmask** by shifting `1` to the position of the bit we want.
2. **Use bitwise AND** with the bitmask and the number. This isolates the bit at the desired position.
   - If the result is `0`, the bit is `0`.
   - If the result matches the bitmask, the bit is `1`.

### 3. Understanding the Code

Letâ€™s walk through the code step by step.

```java
public static int getIthBit(int bin, int i) {
    int bitmask = 1 << i;  // Step 1: Shift 1 left by 'i' positions to create a bitmask for the ith bit
```

1. **Bitmask Creation**: We use the left-shift operator `<<` to move `1` to the `i`th position. This bitmask will help us isolate the bit we want.

```java
    if ((bin & bitmask) == 0) {
```

2. **Bitwise AND Operation**: Using `&` between `bin` and `bitmask` allows us to check if the ith bit is `0` or `1`.
   - If the result is `0`, the bit is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the bit is `1`.

```java
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
```

3. **Return the Result**: Based on the result of the bitwise AND, we return `0` or `1` depending on the value of the ith bit.

### 4. Why Bit Manipulation is Useful Here

Bitwise operations like these allow us to **directly access bits** without converting numbers or performing division. This is particularly efficient for:
- **Checking flags** in programming, where each bit might represent a setting.
- **Efficient data storage**, especially when memory usage needs to be minimized.

### 5. Try It Out: Practice

Run the code above with different numbers and bit positions to see which bits you can extract. For instance, try values like `12` (binary `1100`) and positions `0`, `1`, `2`, etc., to explore how bit masking works.

### Example

In our code:
- **Input**: `10` in binary is `1010`, and weâ€™re checking the 3rd bit (from the right, 0-indexed).
- **Output**: Since the 3rd bit is `1`, `getIthBit(10, 3)` returns `1`.

Experiment and see how this powerful technique can unlock the hidden information within binary numbers! ðŸŽ‰
