Welcome to another day of bit manipulation fun! Today, weâ€™re focusing on **clearing a specific bit** in a number. Think of it like turning off a light switch â€” weâ€™re making sure a certain bit is `0`, no matter what it originally was. Letâ€™s break down this process into simple steps and see how itâ€™s done!

### 1. Introduction to Clearing Bits

Clearing a bit means setting a specific bit to `0` while leaving other bits unaffected. This is a crucial operation in bit manipulation thatâ€™s often used in low-level programming and control systems.

### 2. Why Clearing Bits is Useful

Clearing bits is essential in applications where:
- You need to **disable specific features** or settings.
- You work with **binary flags** where each bit represents a separate setting.
- Efficient data control is important, especially in embedded systems or memory-constrained applications.

### 3. How It Works

To clear the ith bit in a number:
1. **Create a bitmask**: Shift `1` to the `i`th position and invert all bits to get `0` at the `i`th position and `1`s elsewhere.
2. **Apply the AND operator** `&`: Using `&` with this bitmask sets the ith bit to `0` while preserving other bits.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

Let's walk through the code step-by-step.

```java
public static int clearIthBit(int n, int i) {
    int bitmask = ~(1 << i);  // Step 1: Shift 1 to the ith position, then invert all bits to create the bitmask
```

1. **Bitmask Creation**: We shift `1` to the ith bit position, then use the `~` operator to flip all bits. This gives us a bitmask with `0` at the ith position and `1`s everywhere else.

```java
    return n & bitmask;
```

2. **Apply Bitwise AND**: The `&` operation with the bitmask clears the ith bit to `0`, keeping all other bits the same.

### Example

In our example:
- **Input**: Starting with `10` (binary `1010`), we clear the `1st` bit (0-indexed).
- **Output**: The `1st` bit changes from `1` to `0`, so `1010` becomes `1000`, or `8` in decimal. Therefore, `clearIthBit(10, 1)` returns `8`.

### 5. Experiment and Explore

Try clearing different bits in various numbers to see how bitwise operations help control specific bits directly. This skill will sharpen your understanding of bit manipulation and bring you one step closer to mastering binary operations. Enjoy experimenting! ðŸŽ‰
