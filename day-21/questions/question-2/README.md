# üìö Problem: Minimum Cost to Connect N Ropes  

## üß© Problem Explanation  
Imagine you have **N ropes** of varying lengths, and you need to connect them into a **single rope**. The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the **sum of their lengths**. Your goal is to connect all the ropes with the **minimum total cost**.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Rules:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ At each step, you can connect only **two ropes**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **cost** of connecting two ropes is the **sum of their lengths**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ After connecting two ropes, they are replaced by a single rope of their combined length.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Continue until all ropes are connected into one.  

### üßÆ Example:  
#### Input:  
Lengths of ropes: `[4, 3, 2, 6]`  

#### Process:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Combine the two shortest ropes (`2` and `3`):  
   - Cost = `2 + 3 = 5`  
   - New Ropes: `[5, 4, 6]`  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Combine the two shortest ropes (`4` and `5`):  
   - Cost = `4 + 5 = 9`  
   - New Ropes: `[9, 6]`  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Combine the two remaining ropes (`6` and `9`):  
   - Cost = `6 + 9 = 15`  
   - New Ropes: `[15]`  

#### Total Cost:  
`5 + 9 + 15 = 29`

## üí° Approach  

To minimize the total cost, **always combine the two shortest ropes first**. This ensures we minimize the cost of each connection. The best way to efficiently find the two smallest ropes is by using a **min-heap** (a type of priority queue).  

---

## ‚ú® Solution:  
Here‚Äôs how we solve the problem step by step:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Explanation:  
1. **Use a Priority Queue (Min-Heap):**  
   - Insert all rope lengths into the heap.  
   - This allows us to quickly find the two smallest lengths.  

2. **Iteratively Combine Ropes:**  
   - While more than one rope remains:  
     - Remove the two smallest lengths from the heap.  
     - Add their sum (connection cost) to the result.  
     - Insert the combined rope length back into the heap.  

3. **Final Cost:**  
   - The accumulated result is the **minimum cost** of connecting all ropes.

## üî® Code with Explanation:  
Here‚Äôs the Java solution with comments for better understanding:  

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MinimumCostToConnectRopes {
    // Function to calculate the minimum cost of connecting ropes
    static int minCost(int[] ropes, int n) {
        // Create a priority queue (min-heap)
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Add all ropes to the priority queue
        for (int rope : ropes) {
            pq.add(rope);
        }

        int totalCost = 0; // To store the total cost

        // While more than one rope remains
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            // Remove the two smallest ropes
            int first = pq.poll();
            int second = pq.poll();

            // Combine the two ropes and add the cost
            int combinedCost = first + second;
            totalCost += combinedCost;

            // Add the combined rope back into the priority queue
            pq.add(combinedCost);
        }

        return totalCost; // Return the total minimum cost
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ropes = {4, 3, 2, 6};
        int n = ropes.length;
        // Output the minimum cost
        System.out.println("Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes: " + minCost(ropes, n));
    }
}
```

## üåü Example Walkthrough:  
Let‚Äôs take the input `[4, 3, 2, 6]` and walk through the solution:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initialize Min-Heap:**  
`[2, 3, 4, 6]` (smallest element always at the top).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 1:**  
- Combine `2` and `3`: Cost = `5`.  
- New Min-Heap: `[4, 6, 5]`.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 2:**  
- Combine `4` and `5`: Cost = `9`.  
- New Min-Heap: `[6, 9]`.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 3:**  
- Combine `6` and `9`: Cost = `15`.  
- New Min-Heap: `[15]`.  

**Total Cost:**  
`5 + 9 + 15 = 29`.

## üìä Complexity Analysis:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Time Complexity:**  
- Building the heap: \(O(n \log n)\).  
- Combining ropes: \(O(n \log n)\) (each operation takes \(O(\log n)\), and there are \(n-1\) operations).  
- **Total:** \(O(n \log n)\).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Space Complexity:**  
- The priority queue stores all ropes: \(O(n)\).  

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Key Takeaways:  
- Always combine the **smallest two elements** first to minimize the cost.  
- Use a **priority queue** to efficiently manage the smallest elements.  
- This problem is a classic example of a **Greedy Algorithm**, where making the optimal choice at each step leads to the best overall solution.
